# Steering Documents Updates Summary

## Updates Made to Align with All-Python Architecture

### 1. **Development Standards (.kiro/steering/development-standards.md)**

#### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added "Python-First Development" principle
- ✅ Updated code organization to specify Python/FastAPI for all services
- ✅ Added comprehensive Python Technology Stack Standards section
- ✅ Specified agricultural Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, etc.)
- ✅ Added frontend options (FastAPI+Jinja2, Streamlit)
- ✅ Included Python development tools and best practices

#### **New Sections Added:**
```markdown
## Python Technology Stack Standards
### Core Technologies
### Agricultural Python Libraries  
### Frontend Options
### Development Tools
```

### 2. **API Design Guidelines (.kiro/steering/api-design-guidelines.md)**

#### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added "FastAPI Consistency" principle to core API principles
- ✅ Emphasized automatic documentation and validation benefits

### 3. **Other Steering Documents**

#### **No Changes Needed:**
- ✅ **Testing Standards** - Already Python-focused with pytest examples
- ✅ **Security Requirements** - Technology-agnostic, already uses Python examples
- ✅ **Agricultural Domain Guidelines** - Technology-agnostic, focuses on domain knowledge

## **Why These Updates Were Minimal**

The steering documents were already well-designed and mostly technology-agnostic, focusing on:

1. **Agricultural Domain Knowledge** - Timeless principles that don't depend on technology
2. **Python Examples** - Most code examples were already in Python
3. **Best Practices** - General software development practices that apply regardless of stack

## **Key Benefits of Updated Steering Documents**

### **Consistency**
- All documents now explicitly reference the all-Python architecture
- Clear guidance on technology choices and standards
- Unified approach across all development activities

### **Agricultural Focus Maintained**
- Domain-specific requirements remain the priority
- Technology choices support agricultural accuracy and expert collaboration
- Python ecosystem advantages for scientific computing emphasized

### **Developer Guidance**
- Clear technology stack for new team members
- Specific library recommendations for agricultural development
- Consistent patterns across all services

## **Technology Stack Now Clearly Defined**

### **Backend (All Services)**
```python
# Consistent across all 6 services
Framework: FastAPI
Validation: Pydantic
Database: SQLAlchemy (PostgreSQL) + Motor (MongoDB)
Testing: pytest + pytest-asyncio
```

### **Agricultural Libraries**
```python
# Scientific computing
import numpy, pandas, scipy
# Machine learning
import scikit-learn, tensorflow, torch
# NLP for question processing  
import spacy, nltk
# Optimization
import ortools
```

### **Frontend Options**
```python
# Option 1: Traditional web app
FastAPI + Jinja2 + Bootstrap

# Option 2: Data dashboard
Streamlit + Plotly
```

## **Next Steps**

1. **Team Onboarding** - Use updated steering documents for new developers
2. **Code Reviews** - Apply Python-specific standards from updated guidelines
3. **Architecture Decisions** - Reference steering documents for technology choices
4. **Agricultural Validation** - Continue using domain-focused testing standards

The steering documents now provide comprehensive guidance for Python-based agricultural software development while maintaining the critical focus on agricultural accuracy and domain expertise.
