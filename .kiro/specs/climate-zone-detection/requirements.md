# Climate Zone Detection - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing climate zone specification and auto-detection functionality in the Autonomous Farm Advisory System (AFAS). The feature enables farmers to either manually specify their climate zone or have the system automatically detect it based on their location, ensuring accurate crop recommendations tailored to local climate conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Auto-Detection from GPS Coordinates

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to automatically detect my climate zone from my GPS coordinates, so that I don't have to manually research and enter climate information.

3. WHEN elevation data is available THEN the system SHALL adjust climate zone based on elevation effects
4. WHEN coordinates are near zone boundaries THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores and potential alternative zones
5. WHEN auto-detection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 2: Manual Climate Zone Specification

2. WHEN displaying climate information THEN the system SHALL show Köppen type with description (e.g., "Humid continental, hot summer")
3. WHEN Köppen type is determined THEN the system SHALL include precipitation and temperature characteristics
4. WHEN providing agricultural advice THEN the system SHALL consider Köppen climate implications for crop selection
5. WHEN climate data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL estimate Köppen type from available weather data

### Requirement 5: Climate Zone Validation and Consistency

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to validate my climate zone selection against my location, so that I can be confident in the accuracy of my climate data.

**And** display the zone with temperature range and characteristics  
**And** allow me to confirm or override the detected zone  

### Scenario 2: Manual Climate Zone Override
**Given** I know my farm has a specific microclimate  
**When** I manually select a different climate zone than auto-detected

**When** the system detects zone 2a but I select zone 8b  
**Then** the system should show a clear warning about the mismatch  
**And** provide information about typical zones for my location  
**And** allow me to proceed with documentation of the override  

### Scenario 5: Mobile Climate Zone Selection
