# Implementation Plan - Fertilizer Type Selection

## Overview
This implementation plan covers the development of fertilizer type selection functionality that helps farmers choose the best fertilizer type based on their priorities, constraints, and farm conditions.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Set up fertilizer type selection service structure

  - Implement fertilizer classification by type, release pattern, and composition
  - Add nutrient content data for all fertilizer types
  - Create fertilizer compatibility and interaction data
  - _Requirements: US-006.4 - comparing organic, synthetic, slow-release options_

- [ ] 3. Implement priority and constraint input system
  - Create API endpoints for farmer priority input (cost, soil health, quick results)
  - Add budget constraint validation and processing
  - Implement farm size consideration algorithms
  - Create priority weighting and scoring system
  - _Requirements: US-006.1, US-006.2 - priorities and budget constraints_

- [ ] 4. Develop equipment compatibility engine
