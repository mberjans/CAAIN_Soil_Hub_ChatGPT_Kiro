# Farm Location Input - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables farmers to input their farm location through multiple methods (GPS coordinates, address input, or interactive map selection) to provide accurate, location-specific agricultural recommendations. The location data is critical for determining climate zones, soil characteristics, weather patterns, and regional agricultural practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to input my farm location using GPS coordinates, so that I can provide precise location data for the most accurate recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the farm location input interface THEN I SHALL see an option to enter GPS coordinates
2. WHEN I enter latitude and longitude values THEN the system SHALL validate the coordinates are within valid ranges (-90 to 90 for latitude, -180 to 180 for longitude)
3. WHEN I enter valid GPS coordinates THEN the system SHALL display the approximate address for confirmation
4. WHEN I enter invalid GPS coordinates THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with valid range information
5. WHEN I submit valid GPS coordinates THEN the system SHALL store the location data and use it for recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to input my farm location using a street address, so that I can easily specify my location without needing to know GPS coordinates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the farm location input interface THEN I SHALL see an option to enter a street address
2. WHEN I type an address THEN the system SHALL provide autocomplete suggestions based on valid addresses
3. WHEN I select or enter a complete address THEN the system SHALL geocode it to GPS coordinates
4. WHEN geocoding is successful THEN the system SHALL display the coordinates and ask for confirmation
5. WHEN geocoding fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and suggest alternative input methods
6. WHEN I confirm the geocoded location THEN the system SHALL store both the address and coordinates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to select my farm location using an interactive map, so that I can visually identify the exact location of my fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the farm location input interface THEN I SHALL see an option to use an interactive map
2. WHEN I click on the map option THEN the system SHALL display a map interface with my current location (if available)
3. WHEN I click on a location on the map THEN the system SHALL place a marker at that location
4. WHEN I place a marker THEN the system SHALL display the coordinates and reverse-geocoded address
5. WHEN I drag the marker THEN the system SHALL update the coordinates and address in real-time
6. WHEN I confirm the map selection THEN the system SHALL store the location data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to detect my current location automatically, so that I can quickly set my farm location when I'm physically at the farm.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the farm location input interface THEN I SHALL see an option to use my current location
2. WHEN I click "Use Current Location" THEN the system SHALL request geolocation permission
3. WHEN I grant permission THEN the system SHALL detect my current GPS coordinates
4. WHEN location detection is successful THEN the system SHALL display the coordinates and address for confirmation
5. WHEN location detection fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message and offer alternative input methods
6. WHEN I confirm the detected location THEN the system SHALL store the location data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to save multiple field locations within my farm, so that I can get location-specific recommendations for different areas of my operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have entered a farm location THEN I SHALL see an option to add additional field locations
2. WHEN I add a new field THEN I SHALL be able to specify a field name and location using any of the input methods
3. WHEN I save multiple fields THEN the system SHALL store each field with its unique identifier and location
4. WHEN I view my saved locations THEN I SHALL see a list of all fields with their names and coordinates
5. WHEN I select a specific field THEN the system SHALL use that field's location for recommendations
6. WHEN I edit or delete a field THEN the system SHALL update the stored data accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the system to validate and verify my location data, so that I can be confident the recommendations are based on accurate geographic information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter any location data THEN the system SHALL validate the coordinates are within reasonable agricultural areas
2. WHEN coordinates are in non-agricultural areas (oceans, urban centers) THEN the system SHALL show a warning message
3. WHEN I confirm a location THEN the system SHALL display relevant geographic information (county, state, climate zone)
4. WHEN location data seems inconsistent THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation before proceeding
5. WHEN I save location data THEN the system SHALL perform a final validation check
6. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful location storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want the location input interface to work well on mobile devices, so that I can set my farm location while working in the field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the location input on a mobile device THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly
2. WHEN using GPS input on mobile THEN the coordinate fields SHALL be easily tappable and editable
3. WHEN using the map on mobile THEN I SHALL be able to pan, zoom, and place markers with touch gestures
4. WHEN using current location on mobile THEN the GPS detection SHALL work with the device's location services
5. WHEN entering addresses on mobile THEN the autocomplete SHALL work with the device's keyboard
6. WHEN the interface loads on mobile THEN all features SHALL be accessible without horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want my location data to be secure and private, so that I can trust the system with sensitive farm location information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter location data THEN the system SHALL encrypt the coordinates before storage
2. WHEN location data is transmitted THEN it SHALL use secure HTTPS connections
3. WHEN I view my location data THEN only I SHALL have access to the precise coordinates
4. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL use location data without exposing exact coordinates to third parties
5. WHEN I delete my account THEN all location data SHALL be permanently removed
6. WHEN sharing recommendations THEN location information SHALL be generalized (county level) unless I explicitly consent to share precise data
