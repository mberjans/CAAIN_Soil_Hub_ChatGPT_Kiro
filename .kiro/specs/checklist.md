# AFAS Implementation Checklist

## Overview
This checklist provides detailed, granular tasks for implementing the Autonomous Farm Advisory System (AFAS) following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. Each task has a unique ID format: `[TICKET-ID].[TASK-ID]` for precise tracking and completion verification.

## TDD Workflow for Each Feature
1. **Write failing tests first** - Define expected behavior through tests
2. **Implement minimal code** - Write just enough code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor and optimize** - Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage
4. **Verify integration** - Ensure feature works with existing system
5. **Document and validate** - Complete documentation and expert review
