- **Question 1**: "What crop varieties are best suited to my soil type and climate?"

#### FertilizerRecommendationService  
- Comprehensive fertilizer strategy recommendations
- Nutrient need calculations based on yield goals and soil tests
- Fertilizer type evaluation (organic, synthetic, slow-release)
- Economic optimization with cost and ROI analysis
- **Question 5**: "Should I invest in organic, synthetic, or slow-release fertilizers?"

#### SoilManagementService
- Soil health assessment and scoring (0-10 scale)
- pH management with lime recommendations

#### Confidence Scoring
- **Transparent Confidence**: 0-1 scale with detailed breakdown
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Adjusts confidence based on input data completeness
- **Uncertainty Communication**: Clear warnings about limitations
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Soil data, regional data, seasonal timing, expert validation

#### Comprehensive Output
- **Implementation Steps**: Detailed, actionable guidance
- **Expected Outcomes**: Specific results farmers can expect
- **Cost Estimates**: Economic analysis where applicable
- **ROI Calculations**: Return on investment projections
- **Timing Guidance**: When to implement recommendations
- **Follow-up Questions**: Suggested next steps

### 5. Data Models

#### Input Models
- **RecommendationRequest**: Complete request structure
- **LocationData**: GPS coordinates and regional information
- **SoilTestData**: Comprehensive soil test results with validation
- **CropData**: Crop information and rotation history
- **FarmProfile**: Farm characteristics and constraints

#### Output Models
- **RecommendationResponse**: Structured response format
- **RecommendationItem**: Individual recommendation details
- **ConfidenceFactors**: Detailed confidence breakdown

### 6. Testing and Validation

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Unit Tests**: All services and core functionality
- **API Tests**: All endpoints with various scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end recommendation workflows
- **Edge Case Testing**: Invalid data, missing data, extreme values

#### Agricultural Validation
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Iowa corn/soybean farm conditions
- **Extension Guidelines**: Matches Iowa State University recommendations
- **Soil Test Interpretation**: Follows standard soil test guidelines
- **Nutrient Calculations**: Implements 4R Nutrient Stewardship principles

### 7. Performance and Reliability

#### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds for all recommendations (tested)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent and consistent
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful messages
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive agricultural data validation

#### Reliability Features
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing or invalid data
- **Service Isolation**: Modular architecture for maintainability
