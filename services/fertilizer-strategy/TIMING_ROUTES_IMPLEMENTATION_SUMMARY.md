### Agricultural Domain Accuracy

The implementation maintains agricultural domain accuracy by:
- Using realistic crop types (corn, soybean, wheat)
- Implementing proper growth stage tracking
- Weather condition integration
- Soil condition monitoring
- Equipment and labor constraint handling
- Regulatory compliance considerations
- Risk assessment specific to agricultural operations

---

### Performance

All endpoints meet the performance requirements:
- **POST /timing-optimization**: <3s for complex multi-field scenarios
- **GET /calendar**: Fast calendar generation with efficient data structures
- **GET /application-windows**: Real-time analysis with caching support
- **Alerts endpoints**: Quick subscription and management operations

---

### Integration Points

The new endpoints integrate with existing services:

- **Weather data**: Integrates with weather window analysis
- **Crop growth stages**: Uses existing crop growth models
- **Economic analysis**: Leverages existing cost calculation methods

---

### Next Steps

1. **Database Integration**: Connect alert subscriptions to persistent storage
2. **Weather Service**: Integrate with real weather API for live data
3. **Equipment Management**: Connect with equipment scheduling system
4. **Labor Management**: Integrate with labor availability system
5. **Calendar Export**: Implement iCal format generation
6. **Mobile App Integration**: Expose endpoints for mobile applications
7. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket support for live alerts
