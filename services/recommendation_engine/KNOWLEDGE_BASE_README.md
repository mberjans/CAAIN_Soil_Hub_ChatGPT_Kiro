# AFAS Knowledge Base Implementation

## Overview

The Autonomous Farm Advisory System (AFAS) Knowledge Base is a comprehensive agricultural knowledge management system that combines structured data storage (PostgreSQL) with flexible document storage (MongoDB) to provide accurate, evidence-based agricultural recommendations.

## Architecture

### Database Structure

The knowledge base uses a hybrid database approach:

- **PostgreSQL**: Structured agricultural data (crops, soil tests, fertilizer products, weather data)
- **MongoDB**: Flexible knowledge documents, recommendations, and cached data
- **Redis**: Session management and caching

### Key Components

1. **KnowledgeBase** (`knowledge_base.py`): Core data access layer
2. **KnowledgeManager** (`knowledge_manager.py`): High-level recommendation engine
3. **Data Models**: Structured representations of agricultural knowledge
4. **Interpretation Engine**: Soil test and agricultural data analysis

## Features

7. **Environmental Stewardship**: Sustainable practices and conservation
8. **Regulatory Compliance**: Government programs and regulations
9. **Best Practices**: General agricultural guidelines and standards

## Usage Examples

### Basic Soil Test Interpretation

```python
from services.knowledge_base import initialize_knowledge_base

# Initialize knowledge base
kb = initialize_knowledge_base()

# Interpret soil test results
interpretation = kb.get_soil_test_interpretation(
    ph=5.8,
    organic_matter=2.1,
    phosphorus=12,
    potassium=95
)

print(f"Assessment: {interpretation['overall_assessment']}")
# Output: "Priority areas: pH management needed, organic matter improvement needed"
```

### Generate Crop Recommendations

```python
from services.knowledge_manager import initialize_knowledge_manager, create_recommendation_context

# Initialize knowledge manager
km = initialize_knowledge_manager()

# Create recommendation context
context = create_recommendation_context(
    user_id="farmer_123",
    question_type="crop_selection",
    location={"latitude": 42.0308, "longitude": -93.6319},
    soil_data={
        "ph": 6.2,
        "organic_matter_percent": 3.8,
        "phosphorus_ppm": 25,
        "potassium_ppm": 180
    }
)

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = km.generate_recommendations(context)
print(f"Confidence: {recommendations['confidence_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Recommendations: {len(recommendations['recommendations'])}")
```

### Search Agricultural Knowledge

```python
# Search for specific agricultural topics
results = kb.search_knowledge("nitrogen corn fertilizer")
print(f"Found {len(results)} knowledge items")

# Get knowledge by category
nutrient_knowledge = kb.get_knowledge_by_category(
    category=KnowledgeCategory.NUTRIENT_MANAGEMENT,
    expert_validated_only=True
)
```

## Data Quality and Validation

### Agricultural Accuracy Standards

- **Expert Validation**: All critical agricultural logic reviewed by certified professionals
- **Source Attribution**: References to extension services, research papers, and industry standards
- **Regional Calibration**: Recommendations adapted for local conditions and practices
- **Conservative Approach**: System errs on the side of caution when data is uncertain

### Data Quality Assessment

The system automatically assesses data quality based on:

- **Completeness**: Availability of required data fields
- **Recency**: Age of soil tests and other time-sensitive data
- **Consistency**: Logical consistency between related data points
- **Source Reliability**: Credibility of data sources and methods

### Confidence Scoring

Recommendations include confidence scores (0.0-1.0) based on:

- **Data Quality**: Completeness and reliability of input data
- **Knowledge Base Coverage**: Availability of relevant agricultural knowledge
- **Expert Validation**: Proportion of expert-validated knowledge used
- **Regional Applicability**: Match between location and knowledge scope

## Question Types Supported
