### Key Agricultural Principles Applied

#### N2O Emissions
- IPCC Tier 1 default: 1% of applied N converted to N2O
- N2O has 298x global warming potential of CO2
- Highest for urea, ammonium nitrate (surface applied)
- Reduced by nitrification inhibitors, incorporation, slow-release

#### Nutrient Leaching
- Sandy soils: High risk (0.9 factor)
- Clay soils: Low risk (0.1 factor)
- Requires >2 inches rainfall to drive significant leaching
- CEC provides protection (higher CEC = less leaching)
- Organic matter reduces leaching

#### Nutrient Runoff
- P binds to soil particles, moves with erosion
- Slope >6% significantly increases risk
- Incorporation reduces by 50-70%
- Buffer strips filter 40-80% of nutrients

#### Soil Acidification
- Ammonium-based fertilizers acidify soil
- Urea: -1.8 kg CaCO3 equivalent per kg N
- Ammonium sulfate: -5.3 (strongly acidifying)
- Requires lime to neutralize
