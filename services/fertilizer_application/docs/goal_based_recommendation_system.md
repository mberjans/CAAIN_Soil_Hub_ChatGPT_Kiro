# Goal-Based Recommendation System for Fertilizer Application Methods

## Overview

The Goal-Based Recommendation System is a comprehensive multi-objective optimization engine designed to help farmers select optimal fertilizer application methods by balancing multiple competing goals. This system implements advanced optimization algorithms including Pareto optimization, constraint satisfaction, and multi-criteria decision analysis to provide intelligent recommendations tailored to specific farm conditions and farmer priorities.

## Key Features

### Multi-Objective Optimization
- **Yield Maximization**: Optimize for maximum crop yield potential
- **Cost Minimization**: Minimize fertilizer application costs while maintaining effectiveness
- **Environmental Protection**: Minimize environmental impact and ensure regulatory compliance
- **Labor Efficiency**: Optimize labor requirements and equipment utilization
- **Nutrient Efficiency**: Maximize nutrient use efficiency and minimize waste

### Optimization Algorithms
1. **Pareto Optimization**: Find non-dominated solutions that balance multiple objectives
2. **Weighted Sum Optimization**: Combine objectives into a single weighted function
3. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Find solutions that satisfy all specified constraints
4. **Genetic Algorithm**: Evolutionary optimization for complex landscapes

### Constraint Handling
- **Equipment Availability**: Limit methods to compatible equipment
- **Field Size**: Consider field size limitations
- **Budget Limits**: Respect financial constraints
- **Labor Capacity**: Account for available labor resources
- **Environmental Regulations**: Ensure regulatory compliance
- **Timing Constraints**: Respect application timing requirements

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### GoalBasedRecommendationEngine
The main optimization engine that orchestrates the multi-objective optimization process.

```python
class GoalBasedRecommendationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.application_service = ApplicationMethodService()
        self.goal_weights = self._initialize_default_goal_weights()
        self.constraint_handlers = self._initialize_constraint_handlers()
        self.optimization_algorithms = self._initialize_optimization_algorithms()
```

#### Optimization Goals
Defined goals that farmers can prioritize:

```python
class OptimizationGoal(Enum):
    YIELD_MAXIMIZATION = "yield_maximization"
    COST_MINIMIZATION = "cost_minimization"
    ENVIRONMENTAL_PROTECTION = "environmental_protection"
    LABOR_EFFICIENCY = "labor_efficiency"
    NUTRIENT_EFFICIENCY = "nutrient_efficiency"
```

#### Constraint Types
Various constraint types that can limit the optimization:

```python
class ConstraintType(Enum):
    EQUIPMENT_AVAILABILITY = "equipment_availability"
    FIELD_SIZE = "field_size"
    BUDGET_LIMIT = "budget_limit"
    LABOR_CAPACITY = "labor_capacity"
    ENVIRONMENTAL_REGULATIONS = "environmental_regulations"
    TIMING_CONSTRAINTS = "timing_constraints"
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Optimization

```python
# Initialize the engine
engine = GoalBasedRecommendationEngine()

# Create application request
request = ApplicationRequest(
    field_conditions=FieldConditions(
        field_size_acres=100.0,
        soil_type="loam",
        drainage_class="well_drained",
        slope_percent=2.0,
        irrigation_available=True
    ),
    crop_requirements=CropRequirements(
        crop_type="corn",
        growth_stage="vegetative",
        target_yield=180.0,
        nutrient_requirements={"nitrogen": 150, "phosphorus": 50, "potassium": 100}
    ),
    fertilizer_specification=FertilizerSpecification(
        fertilizer_type="npk",
        form=FertilizerForm.GRANULAR,
        cost_per_unit=0.5
    ),
    available_equipment=[
        EquipmentSpecification(equipment_type=EquipmentType.SPREADER, capacity=500)
    ]
)

# Perform optimization
result = await engine.optimize_application_methods(
    request,
    optimization_method="pareto_optimization"
)
```

### Custom Goal Priorities

```python
# Set custom farmer goals
farmer_goals = {
    OptimizationGoal.YIELD_MAXIMIZATION: 0.5,      # 50% weight
    OptimizationGoal.COST_MINIMIZATION: 0.3,        # 30% weight
    OptimizationGoal.ENVIRONMENTAL_PROTECTION: 0.2 # 20% weight
}

result = await engine.optimize_application_methods(
    request,
    farmer_goals=farmer_goals,
    optimization_method="weighted_sum"
)
```

### Constraint-Based Optimization

```python
# Define constraints
constraints = [
    OptimizationConstraint(
        constraint_type=ConstraintType.BUDGET_LIMIT,
        constraint_value=25.0,  # $25/acre budget limit
        operator="le"
    ),
    OptimizationConstraint(
        constraint_type=ConstraintType.EQUIPMENT_AVAILABILITY,
        constraint_value=available_equipment,
        operator="eq"
    )
]

result = await engine.optimize_application_methods(
    request,
    constraints=constraints,
    optimization_method="constraint_satisfaction"
)
```
