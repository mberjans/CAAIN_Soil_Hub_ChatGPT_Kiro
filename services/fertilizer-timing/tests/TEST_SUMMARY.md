## Known Limitations

1. **Stub Services**: Some tests use simplified stubs instead of full service integration
2. **Mock Data**: Weather and soil data are mocked, not from real APIs
3. **Simplified Models**: Some edge cases may not reflect full production complexity
4. **Performance Tests**: Scaled down from full load (50 vs 500 requests)
5. **Geographic Coverage**: Limited to US Midwest test scenarios
