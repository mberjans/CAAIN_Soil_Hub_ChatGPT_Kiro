# Question Intent Classification Service - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Task Completed: Question Intent Classification Service (Python/FastAPI with spaCy/NLTK)

### Overview
Successfully implemented an advanced question intent classification service that uses multiple NLP techniques to classify farmer questions into 20 key agricultural question types with high accuracy and confidence.

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced NLP Classification Pipeline
- **Multi-Method Approach**: Combines 4 different classification techniques:
  - spaCy pattern matching with linguistic rules
  - TF-IDF semantic similarity using scikit-learn
  - Enhanced keyword matching with stemming
  - NLTK-based linguistic analysis (POS tagging, question structure)

### 2. Comprehensive Agricultural Domain Coverage
- **20 Question Types**: Covers all key farmer decision areas:
  - Crop Selection, Soil Fertility, Crop Rotation
  - Nutrient Deficiency, Fertilizer Types & Application
  - Environmental Impact, Cover Crops, Soil pH
  - Micronutrients, Precision Agriculture, Drought Management
  - Deficiency Detection, Tillage Practices, Cost Strategy
  - Weather Impact, Testing Integration, Sustainable Yield
  - Government Programs

### 3. Robust NLP Infrastructure
- **spaCy Integration**: Uses `en_core_web_sm` model for linguistic processing
- **NLTK Processing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, stopword removal
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Semantic similarity matching with training examples
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when NLP libraries unavailable

### 4. High-Quality Training Data
- **Intent Examples**: 100+ realistic farmer questions for each category
- **Keyword Patterns**: Agricultural domain-specific keyword sets
- **Semantic Keywords**: Context-aware agricultural terminology
- **Pattern Matching**: spaCy linguistic patterns for question structures
