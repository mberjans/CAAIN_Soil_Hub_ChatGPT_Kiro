# Data Validation and Cleaning Pipeline Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive data validation and cleaning pipelines for the Autonomous Farm Advisory System (AFAS). This implementation extends the existing data ingestion framework with enhanced agricultural-specific validation, cleaning, and quality assurance capabilities.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Task**: Data validation and cleaning pipelines  
**Status**: Fully implemented and tested  
**Files Created**: 3 new files, 1 modified  
**Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests  

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced Data Validation Pipeline (`data_validation_pipeline.py`)

#### Core Classes:
- **`WeatherDataCleaner`**: Agricultural weather data validation
- **`SoilDataCleaner`**: Soil data validation with agricultural expertise  
- **`DataValidationPipeline`**: Main orchestrator for validation workflows

#### Validation Capabilities:
- **Type Conversion**: Automatic string-to-numeric conversion
- **Range Validation**: Agricultural-specific acceptable ranges
- **Data Correction**: Automatic correction of common issues
- **Normalization**: Standardization of formats and classifications
- **Security Sanitization**: Removal of potentially dangerous content

### 2. Agricultural-Specific Validation Rules

#### Weather Data Validation:
```python
# Temperature ranges with agricultural context
TEMPERATURE_RANGES = {
    "extreme_min": -60.0,  # °F - Physical limits
    "extreme_max": 140.0,  # °F - Physical limits
    "typical_min": -30.0,  # °F - Agricultural range
    "typical_max": 120.0,  # °F - Agricultural range
    "growing_season_min": 32.0,  # °F - Frost threshold
    "growing_season_max": 100.0   # °F - Heat stress threshold
}

# Humidity validation with automatic correction
# Values >100% automatically corrected to 100%
# Negative values corrected to 0%

# Wind speed with agricultural damage thresholds
# >25 mph generates crop damage warnings
```

#### Soil Data Validation:
```python
# pH ranges with agricultural advice
PH_RANGES = {
    "min": 3.0, "max": 10.0,           # Physical limits
    "agricultural_min": 4.0, "agricultural_max": 9.0,  # Agricultural range
    "optimal_min": 6.0, "optimal_max": 7.5             # Optimal range
}

# Nutrient validation with agricultural interpretation
NUTRIENT_RANGES = {
    "phosphorus_ppm": {"min": 0, "max": 200, "optimal_min": 20, "optimal_max": 40},
    "potassium_ppm": {"min": 0, "max": 800, "optimal_min": 150, "optimal_max": 300},
    "nitrogen_ppm": {"min": 0, "max": 100, "optimal_min": 10, "optimal_max": 30}
}
```

### 3. Agricultural Context Integration

#### Contextual Advice Examples:
- **Acidic Soil (pH < 4.5)**: "Very acidic soil - lime application recommended"
- **Low Nutrients**: "Low phosphorus - fertilizer application may be needed"
- **High Wind**: "Wind speeds above 25 mph can cause crop lodging and damage"
- **Low Organic Matter**: "Consider cover crops or organic amendments"
- **Old Soil Tests**: "Soil tests older than 3 years may not reflect current conditions"

### 4. Quality Scoring System

#### Weather Data Quality:
```python
def _calculate_weather_quality_score(self, data, issues):
    base_score = 1.0
    
    # Deduct for issues by severity
    for issue in issues:
        if issue.severity == ValidationSeverity.CRITICAL: base_score -= 0.3
        elif issue.severity == ValidationSeverity.ERROR: base_score -= 0.2
        elif issue.severity == ValidationSeverity.WARNING: base_score -= 0.1
    
    # Factor in completeness (30% weight)
    completeness = present_fields / required_fields
    final_score = (base_score * 0.7) + (completeness * 0.3)
    
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, final_score))
```

#### Soil Data Quality:
- Similar scoring with 15% completeness weight
- Higher penalties for critical soil issues
- Bonus for comprehensive soil test data

### 5. Integration with Existing Framework

#### Enhanced DataIngestionPipeline:
```python
class DataIngestionPipeline:
    def __init__(self, cache_manager, validator, enhanced_validator=None):
        self.enhanced_validator = enhanced_validator or DataValidationPipeline()
        
    async def ingest_data(self, source_name, operation, **params):
        # First pass: Basic validation
        validation_result = await self.validator.validate(raw_data, source_config)
        
        # Second pass: Enhanced cleaning and validation
        data_type = self._determine_data_type(source_config.source_type)
        if data_type:
            cleaning_result = await self.enhanced_validator.validate_and_clean(
                validation_result.normalized_data, data_type, context
            )
```

#### Automatic Data Type Detection:
```python
def _determine_data_type(self, source_type):
    type_mapping = {
        DataSourceType.WEATHER: "weather",
        DataSourceType.SOIL: "soil",
        DataSourceType.CROP: "crop",
        DataSourceType.MARKET: "market"
    }
    return type_mapping.get(source_type)
```

}

# Quality Score: 0.650 (reflects corrections made)
# Issues Found: 4 (with agricultural context)
# Actions Taken: 4 (automatic corrections)
```

### Soil Data Cleaning Example:
```python
# Input (problematic data)
{
    "ph": "5.2",                    # String, acidic pH
    "organic_matter_percent": "1.5%", # String with %, low value
    "phosphorus_ppm": -3.0,         # Invalid negative
    "soil_texture": "sandy loam",   # Needs normalization
}

# Output (cleaned data)  
{
    "ph": 5.2,                      # ✓ Converted, flagged as acidic
    "organic_matter_percent": 1.5,  # ✓ Converted, flagged as low
    "phosphorus_ppm": 0.0,          # ✓ Corrected negative to 0
    "soil_texture": "sandy_loam",   # ✓ Normalized format
}

# Quality Score: 0.600 (multiple issues corrected)
# Agricultural Advice: Lime application, cover crops, fertilizer needs
