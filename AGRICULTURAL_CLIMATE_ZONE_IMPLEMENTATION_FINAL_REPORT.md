# Agricultural Climate Zone Implementation - Final Completion Report

## üéâ Implementation Status: **COMPLETED**

### Issue Resolution Summary
**Resumed from:** Minor indentation error around line 1895 in zone comparison section  
**Resolved:** ‚úÖ **Successfully fixed indentation and completed implementation**

---

## What Was Fixed

### Indentation Error Resolution
- **Location:** Lines 1895-1904 in `/services/frontend/src/streamlit_app.py`
- **Problem:** Incorrect indentation in zone comparison section causing syntax errors
- **Solution:** Corrected indentation alignment for `comparison_df['Your_Zone']` assignment and related code blocks
- **Result:** ‚úÖ All syntax errors resolved, application now loads successfully

### Code Changes Applied
```python
# Before (incorrect indentation):
    comparison_df = pd.DataFrame(neighbor_zones)
        comparison_df['Your_Zone'] = comparison_df['Zone'].str.contains('You')
        
        # Multi-metric comparison
        fig_multi = go.Figure()

# After (corrected indentation):
    comparison_df = pd.DataFrame(neighbor_zones)
    comparison_df['Your_Zone'] = comparison_df['Zone'].str.contains('You')
    
    # Multi-metric comparison
    fig_multi = go.Figure()
```
