## 🌾 The 20 Key Farmer Questions

1. What crop varieties are best suited to my soil type and climate?
2. How can I improve soil fertility without over-applying fertilizer?
3. What is the optimal crop rotation plan for my land?
4. How do I know if my soil is deficient in key nutrients?
5. Should I invest in organic, synthetic, or slow-release fertilizers?
6. How do I decide between liquid vs. granular fertilizer applications?
7. What are the best times to apply fertilizer for maximum uptake?
8. How can I reduce fertilizer runoff and environmental impact?
9. Should I use cover crops, and which ones would benefit my fields most?
10. How do I manage soil pH to optimize nutrient availability?
11. Which micronutrients are worth supplementing in my fields?
12. How do I assess whether precision agriculture tools are worth the investment?
13. What practices will help conserve soil moisture and reduce drought stress?
14. How can I detect early signs of crop nutrient deficiencies or toxicities?
15. Should I adopt no-till or reduced-till practices to maintain soil health?
16. What is the most cost-effective fertilizer strategy given current input prices?
17. How do weather patterns this year affect my fertilizer and crop choices?
18. How can I use soil testing or tissue testing to fine-tune nutrient management?
19. What practices will increase my yields without harming long-term soil health?
20. How do government programs, subsidies, or regulations affect my fertilizer use and land management choices?
