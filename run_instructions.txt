Always create and use local Python envrioment via venv. Read the following files docs/checklist.md, docs/plan.md and docs/tickets.md, if they exists.

IMPORTANT: Before creating any new code, always check the existing codebase thoroughly for existing functions, classes, utilities, or patterns that can be reused or extended to complete the task. Use the codebase-retrieval tool to search for relevant existing code. Only create new code when existing code cannot be adapted or reused for the current task.
If task has already been completed previously or have existinal codeg functional code, add explamation sign "!" between brackets of the checkbox in docs/checklist.md.
For unchecked tasks on the checklists, write the program one task of one ticket at a time. Once task is finshed, check it on the docs/checklist.md, add all changed files to the git using a separate git add command, commit changes with commit message that you generate yourself using individual git commit command, push changes to the git repository with indvidual git push command, and switch to the next task. Once you complete tasks on one ticket, add all changed files to the git using a separate git add command, commit changes with commit message that you generate yourself using individual git commit command, push changes to the git repository with indvidual git push command, switch to the next ticket. After the push, update the momety bank if it exists. Never chain multiple shell command together with & sign. Never use list comprehension in python. Avoid using regular expression for pattern matching. Instead create special pattern matching function to pattern matching. Work until all bugs are fixed. Please do not ask me for conformation whether I want you to proceedto the next ticket. Just keep working until completing the last ticket.

CURRENT TASK TO COMPLETE:
**JOB3-002.1** - Create requirements.txt with ML/CV libraries

PROJECT DIRECTORY: /Users/Mark/Research/CAAIN_Soil_Hub/CAAIN_Soil_Hub_ChatGPT_Kiro_worktrees/job-3-deficiency-detection

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read docs/checklist.md, docs/plan.md, and docs/tickets.md for context
2. Complete the task: **JOB3-002.1** - Create requirements.txt with ML/CV libraries
3. Create any necessary files and write the required code
4. Test your implementation to ensure it works correctly
5. CRITICAL: Update docs/checklist.md to mark this task as complete by changing [ ] to [x]
6. Add all changed files to git: git add <files>
7. Commit changes with a descriptive message: git commit -m "Completed: **JOB3-002.1** - Create requirements.txt with ML/CV libraries"
8. Push changes to the repository: git push

REMAINING UNCHECKED TASKS (79 total):
â†’ CURRENT **JOB3-002.1** - Create requirements.txt with ML/CV libraries
  2. **JOB3-002.2** - Install dependencies
  3. **JOB3-002.3** - Verify TensorFlow installation
  4. **JOB3-002.4** - Verify OpenCV installation
  5. **JOB3-002.5** - Verify Pillow installation
  ... and 74 more tasks

IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
- Execute these steps NOW - do not just plan, actually complete the task
- You MUST update docs/checklist.md to change [ ] to [x] after completing the task
- Focus ONLY on the current task: **JOB3-002.1** - Create requirements.txt with ML/CV libraries
- Provide a summary of what you accomplished when done
- Avoid using regular expressions for pattern matching - create special pattern matching functions instead
