## Test Coverage Summary

### Filter State Management (crop-filtering.test.js)
- ✅ Initialization with empty filters
- ✅ Setting and getting filter values
- ✅ Removing filters
- ✅ Clearing all filters
- ✅ Filter history (undo/redo functionality)
- ✅ Saving and loading filter snapshots

### Result Display and Pagination (crop-filtering.test.js)
- ✅ Displaying results correctly
- ✅ Handling empty results
- ✅ Creating crop cards with correct structure
- ✅ Pagination functionality

### Visualization Charts (crop-filtering.test.js, enhanced-crop-visualization.test.js)
- ✅ Category distribution chart
- ✅ Drought tolerance chart
- ✅ Yield potential chart
- ✅ Cost analysis chart
- ✅ Geographic distribution chart
- ✅ Seasonal trend chart

### Interactive Features (crop-filtering.test.js, enhanced-crop-visualization.test.js)
- ✅ Filter validation
- ✅ Displaying applied filters
- ✅ Chart interactivity

### Export Functionality (crop-filtering.test.js, enhanced-crop-visualization.test.js)
- ✅ Exporting results as CSV
- ✅ Exporting summary as CSV
- ✅ Exporting detailed results as CSV
- ✅ Exporting charts as images

### Performance Optimizations (all test files)
- ✅ Handling large result sets
- ✅ Efficient rendering
- ✅ Performance under load

### Comparison Features (crop-filtering.test.js)
- ✅ Crop comparison setup
- ✅ Comparison workflow

### Cross-component Integration (crop-filtering-integration.test.js)
- ✅ State sharing between components
- ✅ Consistent data formats
- ✅ End-to-end workflow validation
- ✅ Error handling in integrated environment

## Test Methodology

### Mocking Strategy
- DOM elements are mocked to simulate the browser environment
- Chart.js is mocked to test chart creation without rendering
- localStorage and sessionStorage are mocked for testing persistence
- Console methods are mocked to capture logging

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path Tests**: Basic functionality with normal inputs
2. **Edge Case Tests**: Empty results, invalid inputs, boundary conditions
3. **Error Handling**: Missing elements, invalid data, API failures
4. **Performance Tests**: Large datasets, multiple operations
5. **Integration Tests**: Cross-component workflows and state sharing

### Coverage Targets
- Filter state management: 100% coverage
- Result display: 100% coverage
- Chart rendering: 100% coverage
- Interactive features: 100% coverage
- Export functionality: 100% coverage
- Performance optimizations: 100% coverage
- Comparison features: 100% coverage
- Integration workflows: 100% coverage

## Running the Tests

To run the complete test suite, execute:

```bash
npm test
# or
jest
```

To run with coverage:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
# or
jest --coverage
```

## Expected Results

All tests should pass with 80%+ coverage on all metrics (branches, functions, lines, statements). The test suite ensures that:

1. Filters can be applied, saved, and restored correctly
2. Results are displayed properly with pagination
3. Charts update correctly when filters change
4. Interactive elements work as expected
5. Export functionality works for both results and visualizations
6. Comparison features function properly
7. Performance remains acceptable with large datasets
8. Components work together seamlessly in integrated workflows
