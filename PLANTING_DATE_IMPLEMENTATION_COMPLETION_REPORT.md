## 📚 USAGE EXAMPLES

### **Basic Planting Date Calculation:**
```python
service = PlantingDateCalculatorService()
location = LocationData(latitude=42.36, longitude=-71.06, climate_zone="6b")

result = await service.calculate_planting_dates(
    crop_name="corn",

    planting_season="spring"
)
# Returns: optimal dates, safety windows, confidence scores
```

### **API Usage:**
```bash
# Get available crops
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/available-crops

# Calculate planting dates
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/calculate-dates \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"crop_name": "corn", "planting_season": "spring", "location": {...}}'
```
